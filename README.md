# COVID
COVID 19 deaths Vs population density, state by state, USA

"CDC.csv"
https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Death-Counts-by-Week-Ending-D/r8kw-7aab
I deleted the whole country stats from the original file & just left the stats for the states

"Pop_Density.csv"
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/camillol/cs424p3/master/data/Population-Density%20By%20State.csv 
I added NYC pop density = 26403 to the GIT hub file from Wiki page
